                        <p class="article-body">Mechanical Engineering consists of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC). HVAC is a very complex engineering discipline that requires not only theoretical knowledge but practical ‘know how’ in a very demanding and unforgiving environment. Due to the well-known fact that different people feel temperature and humidity factors subjectively, four licensed Professional Engineers of Davidovich & Associates, in conjunction with our experienced designers, are constantly looking into new and innovative ways to enhance the conditions of human habitat in the most economical and technically sound manner. Open ceilings, creative offices, mezzanine levels, life cycles analysis, energy modeling, tall atriums, raised floors, LEED, sustainability concerns, specialty laboratories, sophisticated medical hospital, and research facilities require a new breed of engineering professionals who will thrive on technical challenges and complicated, yet rewarding projects. This is the Davidovich & Associates breed! That is why when Los Angeles’ famous 75-year-old historical landmark, Union Station, decided to install its first HVAC system, they decided to come to Davidovich & Associates for mechanical design!</p>

                        <p class="article-body">If there is anything in a given Davidovich & Associates project that requires electrical power, our engineers will find it. They will find where a device or piece of electrical equipment is, where it is connected to, what voltage and amperage it requires, and how to control it. Electrical, Mechanical, Plumbing, Lighting Fixtures, Low Voltage, Communications, Security, Internet, Elevators, Emergency Generators, Emergency Power, Internal Power Distribution Systems, Single Line Diagrams, Transformers, Panels, and any electrical equipment – all of this is concentrated on hard disks and left in the capable hands of our Electrical Engineering Department. Electrical Engineers need to have a broad experience in order to cover the most complicated issues. In Davidovich & Associates’ eyes, Energy Conservation and Green Design Approach to technical solutions is not only dedicated for the purpose of getting an additional point or two for LEED certification but becomes a matter of pride and satisfaction of joining the global movement for a better life. We are saving the planet, one circuit breaker at a time! This is why Related Companies trusted Davidovich & Associates with a very complicated electrical design of The Santa Monica Village project. Furthermore, The Air Space Corporation used our consulting services to provide a New Emergency Generator system for their entire campus in El Segundo, California</p>

                        <p class="article-body">Plumbing Engineering is often the least appreciated trade among the ten trades that Davidovich & Associate provides. Nevertheless, plumbing is arguably the most important out of all trades. Especially nowadays, when water conservation is even more important than energy conservation. It is an enormously complicated task to provide proper plumbing utilities to a wide variety of projects including water distribution, drainage facilities, sewer facilities, gas distribution, plumbing risers diagrams, restrooms, boilers, pumps, grease interceptors, kitchen facilities, Health Department considerations, etc. Plumbing requires a clear understanding of the purpose, functionality, and maintenance of a myriad of different devices that are necessary to service the technical, industrial, medical, research, and human needs in a large variety of applications.</p>

                        <p class="article-body">By integrating Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing, Life Safety, Lighting and Dry Utilities Design at one firm, D&A engineers take a holistic approach to any LEED-inspired project. The team of engineers presents every client with several options for sustainable systems and efficient designs, including payback information, availability of rebates, and life cycle analysis. This allows each client to make an educated decision regarding the cost vs. benefit of sustainability. D&A’s goal is to customize every project so that it caters to all particular needs of each client. This harmonized approach to design ensures that D&A LEED blueprints are the most cost-efficient and technically sound within the industry.</p>

                        <p class="article-body">Notice the colors of our logo? These are the seven colors of the rainbow, the very essence of nature created a sustainable system. By calling ourselves “Engineers by Nature” we are implementing the principals of nature in all of our work, including the design practices for all ten engineering disciplines we offer. This is why when James Cameron decided to create the next Avatar movie sequels at Manhattan Beach Studios, Davidovich & Associates was asked to design a 1,000 KW solar firm and connect it to the existing 16 KV transmission and distribution system, which was an original design by our firm. While others are talking about fighting global warming, D&A is at the forefront of this very important movement. We are proud to see the results of our efforts! As the lead designers for UCLA solar firms throughout the entire 60,000-people campus, we provide energy audit reports for the largest facilities in the state of California. The majority of our projects are going through serious efficiency scrutiny, which is appreciated by our clients and LEED consultants.</p>
